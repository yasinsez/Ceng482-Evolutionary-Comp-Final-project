"""
PSO-SVM Feature Selection package.

This package provides:
- Data loading helpers for the course datasets.
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based feature selection.
- SVM-based fitness evaluation following the PSO-SVM paper.
- Experiment runners to repeat PSO runs and aggregate results.

All functions are currently stubs and need to be implemented.
